            Limited Liability
          </h3>
          <p>
            Exclusion of damages and limitation of liability. GDL does not
            charge fees for you to access and use the site and content pursuant
            to these T&Cs. The site does not conduct commercial transactions;
            the content is general information and describes some of the basic
            elements of the GDL service. As consideration for your free access
            and use of the site and content pursuant to these T&Cs, you further
            agree that GDL will not be liable to you for any incidental,
            consequential, indirect, special, punitive or exemplary damages
            (including damages for loss of business, loss of profits or the
            like) arising out of or relating to this T&Cs, including without
            limitation, your use or inability to use the site, platform,
            matching services, content, proprietary information, or any
            interruption or disruption of such use, even if GDL has been advised
            of the possibility of such damages and regardless of the cause of
            action (whether in contract, tort, breach of warranty or otherwise).
            The aggregate liability of GDL with regard to this T&Cs will in no
            event exceed USD$1.00. These T&Cs and any additions, changes, edits
            and/or modifications made thereto by GDL cannot be amended except by
            GDL as set forth above. The failure of GDL to exercise or enforce
            any right or provision of these T&Cs will not be a waiver of that
            right. In the event that any provision of these T&Cs will be
            determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
            first revised to give the maximum permissible effect to its original
            intent or, if such revision is not permitted, that specific
            provision will be eliminated so that these T&Cs will otherwise
            remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
